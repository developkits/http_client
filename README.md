http_client
===========

A simple http_client and url parser for c.

Hopefully fully self-explanatory :)

The URL-parser in url.h/url.cpp should be usable by it self.

Note:
-----

This lib is under development and absolutely no guarantees of correctness is given, however all bug-fixes and suggestions are welcome :)
